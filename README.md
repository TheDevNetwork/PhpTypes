PhpTypes
========
A primitive wrappers library for PHP. Uses the best* libs available in the PHP landscape and neatly wraps them
in a single repo, providing aliased classes and some extra features not available in the base classes.

<sub>`*` Based purely on opinion, but download statistics for the respective libs definitely support the bias ;)</sub>
